Project Title:
Crypto Price Simulation Strategies

Description:
This project explores cryptocurrency trading strategies tailored to market volatility using advanced modeling techniques. It integrates Moving Average Crossover Strategies, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Monte Carlo simulations with historical data and significant news events to evaluate performance metrics like ROI, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown for six cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogwifhat (WIF).

Key Findings:
Best Performing Cryptocurrency: WIF achieved a balanced performance with strong ROI (2.826) and minimal risk.
Highest ROI: DOGE demonstrated the highest ROI (8.841) but significant volatility.
News Impact: BTC benefits more quickly from positive news, while ETH sees delayed but substantial gains.
Risk Profiles: PEPE and WIF showed high volatility and poor performance, while BTC and ETH exhibited moderate returns with lower risks.

Methods:
Moving Average Crossover Strategy: To generate buy/sell signals.
Hidden Markov Models: To identify market states (bull, bear, stagnant).
Monte Carlo Simulations: To forecast price paths and risk-return profiles.
Volume Analysis: To examine trading volume as a predictor of price movements.
